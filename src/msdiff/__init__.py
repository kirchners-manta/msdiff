MSDiff
======

This is a simple program to calculate the diffusion coefficient of molecules in a molecular dynamics simulation.
Required input comprises a data file containing the mean square displacement (MSD) as a function of time, with three columns: Time, MSD, and a third quantity which is irrelevant (but added to be suitable with output from the TRAVIS software).
This program is developed by Tom Fr√∂mbgen, (Group of Prof. Dr. Barbara Kirchner, University of Bonn, Germany).
It is published under the MIT license.
