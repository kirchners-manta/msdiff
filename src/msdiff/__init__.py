MSDiff
======

This is a simple program to calculate the diffusion coefficient of molecules in a molecular dynamics simulation.
An MSD calculation by TRAVIS is required as input.
This program is developed by Tom Fr√∂mbgen, (Group of Prof. Dr. Barbara Kirchner, University of Bonn, Germany) and maily designed for the use in this group.
It is published under the MIT license.
